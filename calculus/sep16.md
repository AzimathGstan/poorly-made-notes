### Ex $$y=\lfloor x\rfloor$$

$$ \begin{align}
&\lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = 1 \\
&\lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = 0 \\
&f(1) = 1 \\
\end{align}$$
Therefore the limit does not exist.  But one sided limit does exist. In this case the + side limit is 1 which is equal to the value of the function at 1. Therefore the function is right continuous. 

# Thm 9
If $f(x)$ is continuous at c and $g(x)$ is continuous at $x=f(c)$ then $g\circ f(x) = g(f(x))$ is continnuous at $x=c$
# Thm 10
If $g(x)$ is continuous at $x=b$ and 
$$\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = b$$
then $$\lim_{x\to c}g(f(x)) = g(b) = g(l\lim_{x\to c}f(x))$$
# Thm 11
The Intermediate Value theorem for Continuous Functions
A function $y=f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ takes on every value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then $y_0 = f(c)$, for some $c$ in $[a,b]$

A consequnce for ROot finding for $f(x)=0$, if c is a root of $f(x)=0$ then find c, such that $f(x)=C

1 $\exists a, \text{s.t.} f(a)>0$
...

if $f(\theta)=\theta^3 -2\theta+4$, show that there must exist one root at least between - and -3
pf: 
$$ \begin{align}
&f(0)=0^3-2(0)+4=4 \gt 0\\
&f(-3)=(-3)^3-2(-3)+4=-27+6+4=-17 \lt 0\\
\end{align}$$

By the intermediate theorem, $f(0)=0^3 -2(0)+4=4$ is a
