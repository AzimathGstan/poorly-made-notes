One must remember 
$$
\frac{sinx}{x} = 1 
$$


# implicit differentiation

- differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x
- solve for y'
- y' = dy/dx

# example
- differentiate the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$
- differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x
- $2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$
- $2y \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x$
- $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2x}{2y}$
- $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-x}{y}$

# example


dot line ? 
normal = \frac{-1}{slope}
