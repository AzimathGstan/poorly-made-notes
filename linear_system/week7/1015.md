# Summary - Properties Impulse Response Representation LTI


## Memoryless LTI 
When the impulse response of a system is still a pulse. Then the system is memoryless.

$$
h[n] = c\delta[n]
$$

## Causality 
No output before any input.

$$
h[n]=0 \text{ for } n<0
$$
## stability 
The system is stable if the output is bounded for any bounded input.
In other words, there should be no growth to infinity.

$$
\sum^{\infty}_{n=-\infty}|h[n]| < \infty
$$

## Invertibility

$$
h[n] * h^{inv}[n] = \delta[n]
$$

# Step response
When input is $u[n]$, the output is called the step response.

$$
step[n]=h[x] * u[n] = \sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty}h[k]u[n-k] = \sum^{n}_{k=-\infty}h[k]
$$
When convolution, $u[n-k]$ will only be 1 when $k \leq n$.
Therefore we can replace that $\sum$ with $\sum^n$.

And one can express the impulse response as the difference of the step response.

$$
h[n] = step[n] - step[n-1]
$$
