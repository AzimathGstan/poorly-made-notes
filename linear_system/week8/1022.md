## Example
### Discrete
Consider the difference equation

$$
y[n]+\frac{1}{4}y[n-1]+\frac{1}{8}y[n-2]=x[n]+x[n-1]
$$
We can moving the term to the right.

$$
y[n]=x[n]+x[n-1]-\frac{1}{4}y[n-1]-\frac{1}{8}y[n-2]
$$

Then we can draw the direct form 1 (Straight forward)

According to the commutative property of LTI system, we can exchange the order or side (from diagram perspective) to achieve the Direct Form 2

In this form, we can merge the delay elements to reduce the complexity of the system. And when describing the system, we can use the following equations.

$$
\begin{align}
f[n] &= -\frac{1}{4}f[n-1] - \frac{1}{8}f[n-2] + x[n] \\
y[n] &= f[n] + f[n-1]
\end{align}
$$

### Continuous

Unlike discrete. We need turn the differential equation into integral equation at first.

Consider the differential equation

$$
y''(t)+3y(t)=x'(t)+2x''(t)
$$

Let denote integration as $y^{(n)}$, Therefore the integral equation is

$$
y(t)+3y^{(2)}(t)=x(t)^{(1)}+2x(t)
$$

Moving the term to the right

$$
y(t)=x(t)^{(1)}+2x(t)-3y^{(2)}(t)
$$

Then we can draw

One can see that now $y[n]$ is d
