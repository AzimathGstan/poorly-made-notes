# Continuously convolution solving

Most of the time, the $h(x)$ were given. Then we just need to $f(x) * h(x)$ to get the $y(x)$.

In order to solve the convolution, we can use the following steps:
- Finding the intervals that can be describe in one function.
- Then integrate by intervals.  $\int$
- Finally, sum up the results. ?

## Ex 2.9 Radar
We can describe a radar that measure distance between object as some sort of a delayed while weekend signal.
Thus we can describe it impulse response (system) as:

$$
h(x) = \alpha\delta(t - \beta)
$$
### Matched Filter
$h_m(t) = x(-t)$ ? 
It seems like one can use this to find  $\beta$
