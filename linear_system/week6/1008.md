# Continuously convolution solving

Most of the time, the $h(x)$ were given. Then we just need to $f(x) * h(x)$ to get the $y(x)$.

In order to solve the convolution, we can use the following steps:
- Finding the intervals that can be describe in one function.
- Then integrate by intervals.  $\int$
- Finally, sum up the results.

## Ex 2.9 Radar
We can describe a radar that measure distance between object as some sort of a delayed while weekend signal.
Thus we can describe it impulse response (system) as:

$$
h(x) = \alpha\delta(t - \beta)
$$
### Matched Filter
Used to detect the presence of a known signal in the presence of noise. Which is reflected of known signal $x$.

$h_m(t) = x(-t)$
> Maybe add some thing about finding  $\beta$ 

# Property of Convolution
## Commutative

$$
f(x) * h(x) = h(x) * f(x)
$$
or discrete

$$
f[n] * h[n] = h[n] * f[n]
$$

## Associative

$$
f(x) * (g(x) * h(x)) = (f(x) * g(x)) * h(x)
$$
or discrete

$$
f[n] * (g[n] * h[n]) = (f[n] * g[n]) * h[n]
$$
