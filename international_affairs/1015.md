# The last reflection

I would say that its quite success than I thought.
We prepared cards for our team members.
Make them roleplay as the country on the card.
Such as Brazil, China, United State of America, Great Britain, South Africa, India.

> ADDING

But unfortunately, I think the cards were to biased towards to globalization.
Resulting every members end up thinking that only globalization is the best way to go.
