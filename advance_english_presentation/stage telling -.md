Good afternoon My name is Ezimet.
I like to think about some quite boring question.
Such as What actually a friend is ?
Such weird question right ? 
If today someone ask you about is someone your friend ?
I think most people can answer that very easily.
But when it comes to why he/she is your friend ? 
You might find it not that easy to answer this.

Let demostrate tahat. Let say you have some scenario.

Scenario 1:
There goes one random guy walking on the street and happen to 
passing you. While passing you he greet you. Maybe have some small talk chit chat 
After that would you called him a friend ?

Not really. Would you ? At least I dont 

Scenario 2:
Let say you are in a course. And happen to have some sort of 
group work. So you immediately setup a Line chat group.
And you start exchange some opinion, idea slide something.
But after the semester end, 
would you ever willing to open that chat group again.
Probably not. Then would you called them your friend ?
Perhaps. Afterall you guys are fighting together for your score. 

Scenario 3:
Like scenario 2. But this time this class end like 5 P.M. 
You guy are hungry so you decide to go to restaurant together.
While waiting your food, you guys having some trash talk.
Maybe is about you courses, rubbish your teacher. how bad todays weather is or just how expensive are dishes here 
certainly you can call that a friendship,  probably.

So undoubtly that trash talk is one of the most important quality I looking.
Trash talk is great. Despite I call it trash talk. But I think its the best way to
exchange some information between two guy without being too awkward.
While talking, one can memorize others more easily.
