Good afternoon My name is Ezimet.
I like to think about some quite boring question.
Such as What actually a friend is ?
Such weird question right ? 
If today someone ask you about is someone is your friend ?
I think most people can answer that very easily.
But when it comes to why he/she is your friend ? 
You might find it not that easy to answer this.

Let have some scenario.

Scenario 1:
There goes one random guy walking on the street and happen to 
passing you. While passing you he greet you. After that would you called 
him a friend ?

Pretty much not right ?

Scenario 2:
Let say you are in a course. And happen to have some sort of 
group work. So you immediately setup a Line chat group.
And you start exchange some opinion, idea something.
But after the semester end, you never open that chat group anymore.
Would you called them friends ? 
Perhaps. Afterall you guys talking, fighting for your score. 

Scenario 3:
Like scenario 2. But this time this class end like 5 P.M. 
You guy are hungry so you decide to go to restaurant together.
While waiting your food, you guys having some trash talk.
Maybe is about you courses, weather or just dishes here 
But you doing this every week. You guys know more about each other.

It must be some sort of friendship right ?
