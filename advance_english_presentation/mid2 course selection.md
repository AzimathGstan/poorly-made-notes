I believed that everyone had experience about selecting courses.

For me, the "3 never" principle helps me to choose.
That is.

The courses that you never had chance to take.
The time that you never want to have class.
And the professor that you never want to meet with.

According to this principle
I filled my table carefully, make sure my next semester will be perfect.
Unlike last time.

> maybe add one more pages about last time ?

Last time did not end well.
But this time I believed it won't happen again.
With the perfectly filled and ordered table it must be perfectly fine right ?

Well not at all.

Let see. 1 8:00AM's class. And the class I really want are not in.
At least these courses are quite enjoy to me I guess.

Kay: Hello ?
Me: Oh? Kay. Good Afternoon. Hows your courses went.
Kay: oh~ That went wonderful. I got everything i want perfectly
Me: I see. The only thing i got is "Computer Algorithm"
Kay:  ah~ The one led by the legendary professor.
Me: Legendary ?
Kay: Yes, have you ever heard of kindly Joe.
Me: Yes. 
Kay: Oh he were so mad about that professor. 
	He went that class every week. 
	Took every test he gave.
	Finished every homework he issue.
	And he got B grade.
Me: B grade ? Kindly Joe ? That is absurd.
Kay: Yeah. After that he bombard everyone he met about how bad that professor is.
Kay: You haven't take that class have you ? 
Me: oh, of course not.  (adding some scene about dropping it)
Kay: Then have a good day.
