Everyone had some sort experience about class selection.

For me, the "3 never" principle helps me to choose.
That is.

The courses that you never had chance to take.
The time that you never want to have class.
And the professor that you never want to meet with.

You ordered them on top of list to maximize the change to get those.
And you are just too lazy to get up on the morning.
And sometimes you just want to avoid some professor.

Last time did not end well.
But this time I believed it won't happen again.
With the perfectly filled and ordered table it must be...
EVEN WORSE.
> add more humor

Japanese courses  on 8:00 a.m. , well.
What else do we have...
At least I got one "Computer Algorithm".
Not really sure is a good thing or not.

(Phone ring...)
Kay: Hello ?
Me: Oh? Kay. Good Afternoon. Hows your courses went.
Kay: oh~ That went wonderful. I got everything i want perfectly
Me: I see. The only thing i got is "Computer Algorithm"
Kay:  ah~ The one led by the legendary professor.
Me: Legendary ?
Kay: Yes, have you ever heard of kindly Joe.
Me: Yes. 
Kay: Oh he were so mad about that professor. 
	He went that class every week. 
	Took every test he gave.
	Finished every homework he issue.
	And he got B grade.
Me: B grade ? Kindly Joe ? That is absurd.
Kay: Yeah. After that he bombard everyone he met about how bad that professor is.
Kay: You haven't take that class have you ? 
Me: oh, of course not.  (adding some scene about dropping it)
Kay: Then have a good day.
