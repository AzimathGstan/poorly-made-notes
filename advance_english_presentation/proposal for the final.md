How to quit smoke.

But instead we write that. I propose that we hide our intention.
And wrap it with

"Why shouldn't we quit smoking. "

Problem:
They are several people claim that we should quit smoke. That is ridiculous.
We should stop them. 

Therefore we propose some solution which is let them know the benefit of smoking.

1.How much our financial system can be benefit from smoke tax
Our healthcare and education or even brothers in camp can be benefit from taxes.

2.How health damaging can be a good thing about smoking
Point out that people die earlier can relieve our pension and healthcare system. Reduce overall resource consuming. And benefit to our next generation. Thus decrease the population aging.

3.Compare to something like weed or other drug. And claim that cigarette are the best thing.
smoking make people more energize and work harder.
Thus increase overall productivity
While we can make sure they won't live long enough to consume too much resource. 

That why we ban weed. Is not because weed are damaging to our body. Is because weed are not damaging enough.
While weed is too strong compare to cigarette. Decreasing the people productivity.

While other drug are either too strong or too damaging. Unlike cigarette. Which balanced perfectly.

There for we claim that cigarette is the best tool that government can have to balance its cash flow.
